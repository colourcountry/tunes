Sessions: [where] [when]

The 'when' is chosen so that performances come out in order when sorted alphabetically.

e.g. WFS 13-07 = walthamstow folk session, 2013-07 (July)
or   SSF 14-19a = sheffield sessions festival, 2014, 19th (April in this case), first session of the day

Sometimes an 'x' is added to 'where': SSFx 14-18 168. 
This makes the indexer ignore that performance, because
- I started the tune, but few people joined in (so it's not representative of the session) or
- the session plays a particular tune by tradition (e.g. Borough's ending set)

Performances: [session] [index]
e.g. SSF 14-19a 04

Again '0's are used to make them sort properly.

Tunes: the performance index of the first time the tune was encountered.


Repeats
-------
Tunes repeat a lot, and even contain nested repeats, which doesn't come across well in traditional notation.
Most tunes are played 'AABB', that is, play the A line twice then the B line twice. This is shown with a single repeat.

A = Bc| ded B2G A2F D3 G2G BGB d2c A3 ded B2g f2e c2A d2d cBA G3
AA = Bc| ded B2G A2F D3 G2G BGB d2c A3 ded B2g f2e c2A d2d cBA G3 :|

But the A and B parts often also repeat the initial few bars, to give a line with 2 alternates

A1 = GA| B2D DED E2G e3 d2B BAG B2A A
A2 = GA| B2D DED E2G e3 d2B ABA G3
A  = GA| B2D DED E2G e3 |1 d2B BAG B2A A :|2 d2B ABA G3
AA = GA| B2D DED E2G e3 |1,3 d2B BAG B2A A :|2,4 d2B ABA G3 :|

Occasionally A1 is identical to A2, so 'A' gets played 4 times.
When this happens, the last bar is marked |1,2,3,4 to distinguish it from the single repeat above.

AA = F2F E2F GFE F2D FGF E2F |1,2,3,4 GFE D3 :|

Note the difference between
a) W |1,3 X :|2 Y :|4 Z  =  WX WY WX WZ    
b) W |1,3 X :|2 Y :|  Z  =  WX WY WX Z
Both are common. (Normally Z is twice as long in case b, but don't rely on it.)

The double percent sign is used when one line repeats part of a previous line.
Often A2 (the second repeat of the A part) is used as the second half of the B part.
There is special support in the formatter to turn the directive [P:(XX)] into an instruction to repeat XX.

P:B
g3 f3 e3 def g2g f2f e2e d2c [P:(A2)] :|

The % double percent is also used for AABA tunes.

P:B

Anacrusis
---------

With strict traditional notation, often a section needs to be written out with |1 and |2 only because of the anacrusis
to the next part of the tune.

P:A
GA| B2dB AGA2 GABc d2ef |1,3 gfge dBGd e2A2 A2GA :|2 gfge dBGA B2A2 G2GA :|4 gfge dBGA B2A2 G2d2
P:B
edef gfge dBGB d2d2 edef gfge dBGB A2GA B2dB AGA2 GABc d2ef :|1 gfge dBGA B2A2 G2d2 :|2 gfge dBGA B2A2 G2

By bending the rules slightly, we can identify more repeated sections:

P:A
GA| B2dB AGA2 GABc d2ef |1,3 gfge dBGd e2A2 A2 :|2,4 gfge dBGA B2A2 G2 :|
P:B
d2| edef gfge dBGB d2d2 edef gfge dBGB A2 [P:(A2)] :|

Repeats are written out where the body of the repeated section would only be one bar long.
For sanity, alternatives are only allowed to start at the beginning of a bar, although this often collides with
the previous rule :(

In other tunes the parts have anacrusis of different lengths.
I relax the rule that "the last bar of a repeat/repeat alternative + the anacrusis = a full bar".
The last note is always shown as the shortest note that would fit before any of the possible following anacruses.
That is, if the last note is a quaver, there will come a point that you only get to play a quaver. Other times you
may need to lengthen this note until the anacrusis or barline that starts the line you are going to play next.
Conversely, sometimes players don't play the anacrusis in a particular place. This is shown by lengthening that last note
to 'overlap' with the anacrusis.
(It's less complicated than it sounds.)

Rhythm
------
Swung tunes are generally notated in straight quavers.
The degree of swing can vary between players from almost none (1:1) to fully dotted (3:1)
so the general direction 'swung' is used for performances with a significant amount.

12/8 is only used when there are a significant number of 'triplets' that are not just decorations (e.g. The Fiery Clock Face)
