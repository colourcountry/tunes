The AB format
-------------

This is a restricted form of the ABC format specifically for transcribing and exchanging tunes.
It is intended to act as a common baseline which will be understood by any ABC2.x compliant software
and which is less fragile to rough treatment.

By design, any AB file is also an ABC file compliant with the ABC 2.1 standard without conversion.
AB does not support formatting, most decorations, expression marks or multi-part music.
Use ABC if you want these.

The intent of AB is that 99% of the tunes in ABC files out there should also be AB files already.
The remainder are either not suitable for AB or can be manually fixed.

Format of an AB file
--------------------

<AB-file> :: (<tune>\n)+
    An AB file may not have a file header.
    There must not be whitespace at the beginning of an AB file.
    An AB file must be encoded in UTF-8.
    AB files may not contain comments. Use r: fields instead.


<tune> :: <header><body>

<header> :: <X field><T field>?<[ABCDFGHNOPQRrSTWZ] field>*<K field>
    FIXME:continuation

<field> :: [ABCDFGHKLMNOPQRrSTXZ]:.*\n
    The I, m and U fields are not supported because they alter the format itself.
    Within a field, the \uxxxx notation is available to represent any character.

<body> :: (<note>|<connector>|<inline-field>|<whitespace>|\n)*\n
    Music is whitespace agnostic.
    There is no continuation character, and newlines within the body have no special meaning.
    The characters [H-Zh-wy#*;?@] may only exist in the body as part of a field.

<note> :: <trill>?<accidental>?<pitch><octave>?<duration>?

<trill> :: [~!]

<accidental> :: [_=^]

<pitch> :: [A-Ga-gxz]

<octave> :: [,']

<duration> :: [0-9]+/[0-9]+) | / | /[0-9]+
    Use '/4' instead of '//'.

<connector> :: TODO

<inline-field> :: [[][KLMNPQRr]:[^]]*[]]
    The I, m and U fields are not supported because they alter the format itself.
    The s and w fields are not supported because in ABC they are only allowed in the tune body but are not allowed to be inline.
    The W field is not supported in the tune body because in ABC it is not allowed to be inline.
    The V field is not supported in AB1.0 but may be supported in a future version.
    Within a field, the \uxxxx notation is available to represent any character.
    The ']' character must be notated as '\u005d' to avoid ending the field.

Deprecated fields
-----------------
Fields [ABCDFGHORSZ] are deprecated.
AB-supporting programs which also support ABC should provide the option to preserve them,
or to replace them with appropriate N: fields, preserving ordering and content.

AB+
---
An AB+ file is like an AB file except
1. All fields are inline fields. White space outwith fields has no special meaning.
2. Only fields may be placed between an [X:] field and the following [K:] field.
    This is because the [P:] field has a special meaning in this position.

Unfortunately an AB+ file is not a valid ABC file.

AB+ can be easily converted to AB by "de-inlining" the fields between (and including) an [X:] and its following [K:].

Programs which declare support for AB should also support AB+.
An AB+ file can be detected because it must begin with '[X:'
