This repo contains
- ABC files gleaned from the web (may be under copyright)
- ABC files I have transcribed myself
- a Python program that converts (certain) ABC files to lilypond format

Dependencies:

Honestly I have no idea.
I tried it on a fresh Fedora install and ended up installing

- texlive-*
- fontconfig-*

which is the best part of 5,000 packages.
It is likely they are not all dependencies.
